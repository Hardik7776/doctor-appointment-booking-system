# doctor-appointment-booking-system

The Doctor Appointment Booking Website is a fully responsive front-end project designed to simplify the process of scheduling medical appointments online. The core objective of this project was to create a user-friendly and accessible interface for patients to interact with healthcare providers, while also showcasing the practical application of web development fundamentals using HTML and CSS.

This website allows users to seamlessly browse available doctors, view their profiles, and book appointments based on preferred time slots. The design replicates a real-world healthcare booking system, focusing on clean layout, intuitive navigation, and mobile responsiveness. The homepage includes a structured header with navigation links, a hero section introducing the platform, and service highlights. Patients can view doctor listings in a card-based layout that presents names, specialties, availability, and booking options clearly.

The booking form is designed using HTML form elements with validation-ready inputs for name, contact information, preferred date, and time selection. The layout is structured using CSS Flexbox and Grid systems to ensure content adapts gracefully across various screen sizes. Responsive design was implemented using media queries to provide a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Although this version is front-end only, the project is structured in a scalable manner, making it suitable for backend integration in the future (such as using PHP, Node.js, or Firebase for real-time appointment handling). Accessibility features, such as properly labeled form fields and keyboard navigation support, were also considered to ensure inclusivity.

This project not only helped strengthen practical skills in semantic HTML and modern CSS design but also provided a deeper understanding of how real-world applications in the healthcare domain can be digitized for greater convenience. It serves as a foundation for more advanced projects involving interactivity, authentication, and database connectivity.
